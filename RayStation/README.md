[//]: # (RadCollision-RayStation)

This folder contains one flavor (or interface layer) of RadCollision. For other languages, consult https://github.com/mghro/rad-collision

Licensing
---------

Please refer to https://github.com/mghro/rad-collision/blob/main/README.md

Requirements
------------

- Raystation version 8B or higher
- 3D model of your nozzle and couch (optional) as STL files

For first attempts, you can use the open-source STL files stored in this [PR](https://github.com/mghro/rad-collision/issues/21#issuecomment-1073840985) or in [https://github.com/SlicerRt/SlicerRT/tree/master/RoomsEyeView/TreatmentMachineModels](SlicerRT).

How to use
----------

- Create a new script in RayStation and paste the contents of collision_detection.py
- Modify the path where the STL files are stored, to point at your own drive


3D model format
---------------

- The file type should be STL
- The model origin shall be in the isocenter
- The perspective should match that of an observer standing in front of the gantry
- More information is given in the header of collision_detection.py

Known issues
------------

- See https://github.com/mghro/rad-collision/issues
- It does not handle yet custom PatientOrientations
- RayStation (10A) crashes if you import STL geometries that are not closed surfaces
- RayStation (10A) crashes when calculating DSC for very complex geometries with holes
